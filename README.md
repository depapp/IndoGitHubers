# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# how to setup
- Fork the project
- After you've cloned your fork of the project, you will need to make a branch

```
$ git checkout -b name-of-branch
$ npm install
```

- Make any changes, save your work, and make the necessary commits 
    - Example: fixes-issue-xxx or feature-issue-xxx 
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "fixes-issue-xxx" 
$ git status

# Push the code to the branch you made
$ git push origin name-of-your-branch

```
- Once you've pushed your branch, don't forget to make a pull request into the `master` branch.
